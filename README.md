#Match Simulator: In cricket, predicting the outcome of a match is not just about team strength but also about dynamic factors such as pitch behavior, match phase, and team strategies. A tactical match simulator provides an innovative way to understand how these factors evolve throughout a match.

The match simulation is based on a ball-by-ball prediction model, where each delivery outcome (runs, wickets, boundaries) is determined using probabilities derived from historical data. Players’ batting and bowling skills, along with pitch conditions, influence the outcome of each ball in real-time.

Here's the Match summary of the inning played in Wankhede, Mumbai. Total: 180/6 in 20.0 overs Run Rate: 9.00

The Tactical Match Simulator shows how match dynamics unfold and how each ball can change the course of a game. Future versions will incorporate live player data and more sophisticated models to predict outcomes more accurately.


#Opponent Strategy: In high-stakes T20 matches, the ability to anticipate the opponent’s tactical moves (like death-over bowling plans or powerplay intent) gives teams a massive edge.

Traditionally, this insight comes from manual analysis by coaches and video analysts — but that’s slow, inconsistent, and reactive. This project introduces an AI-powered tactical prediction engine that learns from team-specific behaviors, match situations, and venue factors to forecast how an opponent is likely to play — before the game begins or in real-time.

We approached the problem in three parts:

Data Collection

Collected ball-by-ball data from IPL & T20 leagues

Engineered features like match phase, opposition, venue, required run rate, batsmen type, bowler type

Model Building

For each phase (Powerplay, Middle Overs, Death Overs), trained classification models using:

Random Forest for strategy type (e.g., yorker-heavy, bouncer-heavy, spin-rotation)

XGBoost for decision trees when optimizing for tactical outcomes.

CSK and RCB prepare for a tactical battle. RCB, predicted to be aggressive in the powerplay (100% model accuracy), aims for early dominance. CSK's middle-over strategy is less certain (100% accuracy) but leans towards spin. The death overs will likely see CSK rely on spin, predicted with 100% accuracy. A dedicated CSK vs RCB model also forecasts an aggressive approach from RCB.

Team-Specific Strategy Model (e.g., CSK vs RCB) Under the Chinnaswamy Stadium lights, Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore prepare for a tactical duel. Surprisingly, the data whispers a tale of caution. CSK, known for their calculated aggression, are predicted to adopt a conservative approach. Perhaps wary of RCB's formidable batting lineup on their home turf, they'll prioritize building a solid foundation, accumulating runs steadily rather than risking early wickets. This unexpected approach adds a layer of intrigue, leaving fans wondering if CSK's calculated restraint will outsmart RCB's firepower or if it'll backfire, allowing RCB to seize control. The stage is set for a captivating clash of contrasting strategies.
